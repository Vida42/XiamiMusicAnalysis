# Get the artist_name, artist_genre info of artists

Using artist_ID to get these infomation.


## Issues

Here I classified artists into Two major categories.

### A.

some are from stage_3:
order   ixiami_url

### B.

others:
order   artist_ID

There are two kinds of artists in this case B:

#### B1. 
normal artist

#### B2. 
hidden ixiami artist

some artists are xiami artists, but their songs are included in albums. So when I collected infomation of their sons during [03_songs_info](https://github.com/Vida42/XiamiMusicAnalysis/tree/master/01_data_prep/03_songs_info), we can find the artists_ID, album_ID and album_name. eg:

```
2615823 cqXa2e5c94  dB5F3c3b8   nWxKff385   嘎调
2615831 cqXa3ec25a  dB5F3c3b8   nWxKff385   嘎调
2616106 cqXa51de50  dB5F3c3b8   nWxKff385   嘎调
```

But they are still Xiami Artists, so ways to get their information would be different from that of normal artists.
